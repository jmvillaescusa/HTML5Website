My 5 Favourite Video Games

After considering for some time, I've created a list that contains my favourite games of all time. This list is just my personal opinion, and it should not affect yours, as list like these are purely subjective. With so many games to release in the coming years, and the games released that I've played or have yet to try, I'll be considering the games that I played to completion. These games below influenced my gaming life and left a lasting impression for me. These below are what I can play them at any point of my life and still find enjoyment out of them: they are what I considered timeless classics.

Super Mario Bros. 3 [SNES] (1988)

The first game I've played (in recolection) 

Super Smash Bros. Melee [NGC] (2001)
