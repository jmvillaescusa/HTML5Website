Games Looking Forward to 2018 and Onwards

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate [Switch]

This game releases on December 7th of this year. I will be playing this along side Melee, but be using the Switch Pro controller instead of the Gamecube controller.

Katamati Damacy Reroll [Switch]

Started on the PS2, and will release the same date as Ultimate, but I will eventualy get this game. This game looks like it will be up my alley, so I'm keep this under my radar.

Final Fantasy IX [Switch]

Getting this because it was announced during the September Nintendo Direct (same with Katamari Damacy Reroll). Heard great things about this game, but wasn't able to play this early on since I didn't own a PS1. This should release sometine in 2019.

Pokemon Switch Game (title pending) [Switch]

Nintendo did confirm that there is a new Pokemon game, but it has yet to be announced. Getting this over Lets Go Pikachu/Eevee because of lack of interest.

Tetris Effect [PS4]

This game just released to great critical reception and I love playing Tetris. Going to get this when its on sale (its abit pricy right now).

Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice [PS4]

FromSoftware, developers of the Soulsborne series, are also developing this game. Of the games I listed so far, this one is what I'm looking forward to the most. It will release March 22, 2019.

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night [PS4]

The producer of this game, Koji Igarashi, is a former employee of Konami and is known for the Castlevania series. I've pledged to the kickstarter for this game 3 years ago, and been following the development for it. It should release 2019.

The Last Night [PC]

Saw this at the E3 2017 Microsoft conference, and was amazed by the visual desgn alone. Will be checking on this game, whenever it releases.

Ori and Will of the Wisp [PC]

Also saw this in the in the same E3 conference. Loved the first one, and hoping this will release on Steam.

My Friend Pedro [PC]

Looks like a silly fun game, and considering its from the pupblisher Devolver Digital, it will look like it has a intricate learning curve. It will release sometime 2019 on Nintendo Switch and PC.
