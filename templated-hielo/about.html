								<h2>My Video Gaming Bio</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I have been playing for more than 10 years, first introduced by my brother. We would both play Super Mario Bros. 3 from the All-Star version, taking turns trying to finish the game (but we never do). From then on, I've been playing video games since then: playing on the DS, 3DS, and the Switch whenever my family and I travel to various locations; playing the PS2, Wii, PC, and PS4 when I am at home. I watch various let's play, walkthroughs, and analysis video on a variiety of games on Youtube, and watch different streams and touranments on twitch.</p>
							<p>During my school life, at first I did pretty OK in the subjects I took. Then I started feeling complacement by high school, soon I got lazy and became socially inept. I began to struggle on completing homework and projects, and barely pass my courses. Ultimately, I failed my Physics, Computer Science and Mathematics courses. I still managed to graduate within the four years of high school, but with poor grades.</p>
							<p>I took eight months off from school before I took the triOS College program, trying to improve myself mentally (which in hindsight, seems like I made no progress). I continued to play video games and watch Youtube/twitch at home.</p>
							<p>As I was searching for a school program for my career, and found triOS college. The reason I took this program is because of the prequisites. Other schools of the same program require students to have good grades in the 12-Physics and 12-Mathematics courses (which I've failed both). triOS' prerequisites for it is just a high school diploma (which I have). What I'm look for out of this program is to improve my communication skills and my work ethics. I intend to graduate from this program and find a career job within this field, because I love video games.</p>
